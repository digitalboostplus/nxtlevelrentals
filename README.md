### Role Seeding Script

Use `scripts/seed-roles.js` to create the required Firestore documents for your super admin, admin, and tenant users. Install Firebase Admin locally (`npm install firebase-admin --save-dev`), then run:

```bash
node scripts/seed-roles.js path/to/serviceAccountKey.json
```

Update the placeholder UIDs in the script before executing it; the values should match the Firebase Authentication UIDs for your super admin, admin, and tenant accounts. You can re-run the script any time you add new users.
